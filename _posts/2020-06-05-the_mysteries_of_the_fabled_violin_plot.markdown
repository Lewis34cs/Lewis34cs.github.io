What is the violin plot? Where did it come from? Can you play it? 

To the casual person, reading a violin plot may seem somewhat of an enigma, but if you harness its abilities and understand its strengths and weaknesses, it can be a powerful ally.

The violin plot was created back in 1997 and introduced to the world through the NCSS statistical software. It received its name through one of the first analyses it produced which looked similar to - you guessed it - a violin. Violin plots may be intimidating at first glance, but can provide much more information than your average bar chart or box plot. Violin plots have the ability to display something like a box plot inside of their violin-shaped (some of the time) bodies. Not only that, but their body represents the density trace of the entirety of data.
