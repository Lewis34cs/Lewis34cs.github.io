op factors that play a major role when determining the selling price of a house (within our designated range of values) in Kings County in Washington State:
the sqft living area of a house
grade of a house
if it is considered a waterfront property
if people have shown interest in your house and have viewed it
the average sqft living area of your 15 closest neighbors' houses
the age of your house
if your house has been renovated
and most importantly, the subregion the house resides in.
